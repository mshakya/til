#scroll in a screen
    
When using `screen`, one cannot scroll in the terminal with mouse or up key. This is because `screen` has its own buffer. 
So, when one wants to scroll, do the following:

    - Press `control` + `A` and then press `Esc`.
    - Move up/down with arrow keys.
    - When done scrolling hit `enter/return` twice
